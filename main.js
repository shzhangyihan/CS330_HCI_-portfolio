    description:
      'With nearly every new swarm robotic platform built, the designers\
    develop its software stack, from low-level drivers to high-level algorithmic \
    implementations. And while the different software stacks\
    frequently share components, especially in robot-to-robot communication, \
    these common components are also developed from\
    scratch time and again. We present SwarmTalk, a new communication \
    library that can be quickly ported to new and existing swarm\
    hardware. SwarmTalk adopts a publish-subscribe communication\
    model that satisfies the severe hardware constraints found in many\
    swarms, and provides an easy-to-use programming interface. We\
    port our SwarmTalk prototype to two hardware swarm platforms\
    and two simulator-based platforms, and implement commonly-used\
    swarm algorithms on these four platforms. We present the design\
    and implementation of SwarmTalk, discuss some of the system challenges \
    in implementation and cross-platform porting, and report\
    on our initial experiences as a common communication abstraction\
    for a community benchmarking suite.<br><br>\
